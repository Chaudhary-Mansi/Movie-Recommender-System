**Project Overview**
This project implements a Movie Recommender System that suggests movies based on user preferences. The system analyzes movie data using content-based filtering techniques to recommend similar titles. The project aims to provide personalized recommendations, enhancing user experience.

**Features**

Content-based recommendation engine.

Analysis of movie metadata, such as genres, cast, and keywords.

Scalable and efficient implementation suitable for real-world applications.

**Dependencies**

The project uses the following Python libraries:

warnings

pandas

numpy

ast

nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)

nltk.stem

nltk.corpus

sklearn (scikit-learn)

sklearn.feature_extraction.text

sklearn.metrics.pairwise

pickle

Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the project. Install them using pip:

pip install pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn

**How It Works**

**Data Loading:** Movie metadata is loaded and preprocessed.

**Feature Engineering:** Text-based features such as genres, cast, and keywords are processed.

**Recommendation Algorithm:** A content-based approach calculates similarity scores using:

Cosine similarity for measuring closeness between movies.

Model Persistence: The trained recommendation model is serialized using a pickle for reuse.

**How to Run**

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommender-system.git
cd movie-recommender-system

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Movie-Recommender-System.ipynb

Please follow the instructions in the notebook to go ahead and execute the recommendation pipeline.

**Dataset**

The system uses a movie metadata dataset. Before running the code, ensure the dataset file (e.g., movies.csv) is available in the project directory.

**Output**

Movie recommendations based on user-selected titles.

Visualizations and insights into the recommendation process.
